# YoutubeEditPlayerHeight
A Firefox addon mainly intended for personal use.

Increases the video player height to fill the window. Improve YouTube! version does not scale the video correctly when changing window width, so I made my own that works the way I want it to.

Using with [Improve YouTube! (Open-Source for YouTube)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-addon/) with force Theater mode and [Truffle Tv](https://truffle.vip/extension). Have not tried without or with other addons that change Youtube.
